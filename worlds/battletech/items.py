    # Archipelago requires that each world submits as many locations as it submits items.
    # This is where we can use our filler and trap items.
    # APQuest has two of these: The Confetti Cannon and the Math Trap.
    # (Unfortunately, Archipelago is a bit ambiguous about its terminology here:
    #  "filler" is an ItemClassification separate from "trap", but in a lot of its functions,
    #  Archipelago will use "filler" to just mean "an additional item created to fill out the itempool".
    #  "Filler" in this sense can technically have any ItemClassification,
    #  but most commonly ItemClassification.filler or ItemClassification.trap.
    #  Starting here, the word "filler" will be used to collectively refer to APQuest's Confetti Cannon and Math Trap,
    #  which are ItemClassification.filler and ItemClassification.trap respectively.)
    # Creating filler items works the same as any other item. But there is a question:
    # How many filler items do we actually need to create?
    # In regions.py, we created either six or seven locations depending on the "extra_starting_chest" option.
    # In this function, we have created five or six items depending on whether the "hammer" option is enabled.
    # We *could* have a really complicated if-else tree checking the options again, but there is a better way.
    # We can compare the size of our itempool so far to the number of locations in our world.

    # The length of our itempool is easy to determine, since we have it as a list.
    number_of_items = len(item_pool)

    # The number of locations is also easy to determine, but we have to be careful.
    # Just calling len(world.get_locations()) would report an incorrect number, because of our *event locations*.
    # What we actually want is the number of *unfilled* locations. Luckily, there is a helper method for this:
    number_of_unfilled_locations = len(world.multiworld.get_unfilled_locations(world.player))

    # Now, we just subtract the number of items from the number of locations to get the number of empty item slots.
    needed_number_of_filler_items = number_of_unfilled_locations - number_of_items

    # Finally, we create that many filler items and add them to the itempool.
    # To create our filler, we could just use world.create_item("Confetti Cannon").
    # But there is an alternative that works even better for most worlds, including APQuest.
    # As discussed above, our world must have a get_filler_item_name() function defined,
    # which must return the name of an infinitely repeatable filler item.
    # Defining this function enables the use of a helper function called world.create_filler().
    # You can just use this function directly to create as many filler items as you need to complete your itempool.
    item_pool += [world.create_filler() for _ in range(needed_number_of_filler_items)]

    # This is how the generator actually knows about the existence of our items.
    world.multiworld.itempool += item_pool
